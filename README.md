# MULTI MODAL APPROACH FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS CLASSIFICATION USING GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS

The following explain how the code is distributed 

1- All the files that end with .pth in the "best_models_GNN" folder are the weights of the trained models

2- "Baseline_Models" folder contain the baselines ordered by "DecisionTree_models" and "SVM_models".

3- "Data_preprocessing" contain all the files necessary for the data preprocessing of the project

4- "GNNs" contain all the necessary files to run the GCN and GAT approaches


WARNING: you should change the paths in order to run your code.

Data used in the study is not publicly available due to sensitivity concerns, thought could be available from
